        <h1> CPSC 349 - Front End Engineering Assignment: 1</h1>
        <h2>Why I Am In This Course:</h2>

<section>
        <p>I enrolled in Front End Engineering in order to learn how to develop slick websites.  I want to start a small food catering business
            on the side and design the website for it myself.  This is my first time doing any sort of web development but I feel like my ambition and
            desire to learn will help me push through and develop a modern/attractive looking website.  I hope to learn modern design implentations through
            the course of the class.
